  question: Which of the following algorithms is used to find the shortest path in
    a weighted graph?
  questionImage: {fileID: 21300000, guid: 35de1349cd6d46f4dbad82d1121e9e74, type: 3}
  answerA: Depth-First Search (DFS)
  answerB: Breadth-First Search (BFS)
  answerC: Dijkstra's algorithm
  answerExplanation: Dijkstra's algorithm is used to find the shortest path in a
    weighted graph. It calculates the shortest path from a source node to all other
    nodes in the graph, considering the weights of the edges. Depth-First Search
    and Breadth-First Search are graph traversal algorithms.
