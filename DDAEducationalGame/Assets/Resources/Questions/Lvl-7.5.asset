  question: What is the time complexity of a linear search algorithm?
  questionImage: {fileID: 21300000, guid: 7c7c921a630761044ba464b4f18a8fe2, type: 3}
  answerA: O(n)
  answerB: O(log n)
  answerC: O(1)
  answerExplanation: A linear search algorithm has a time complexity of O(n), where
    "n" represents the number of elements in the data set being searched. It means
    that the time taken to search increases linearly with the size of the data set.
