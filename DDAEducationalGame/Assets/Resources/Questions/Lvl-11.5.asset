  question: What is the time complexity of the insertion operation in a balanced
    binary search tree (BST)?
  questionImage: {fileID: 21300000, guid: d284a985e1811fc4ab9ee2cd17b93a30, type: 3}
  answerA: O(log n)
  answerB: O(n)
  answerC: 'O(1) '
  answerExplanation: In a balanced binary search tree, the insertion operation has
    a time complexity of O(log n) on average. The tree structure allows for efficient
    insertion and search operations by maintaining a balanced height, ensuring logarithmic
    complexity.
