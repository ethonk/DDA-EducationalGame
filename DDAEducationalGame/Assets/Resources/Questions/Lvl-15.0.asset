  questionImage: {fileID: 0}
  answerA: The size of the largest input
  answerB: The worst-case time complexity
  answerC: The best-case time complexity
  answerExplanation: The worst-case time complexity. Big O notation is used in computer
    science to express the worst-case time complexity of an algorithm as a function
    of the input size. It provides a way to analyze and compare the efficiency of
    algorithms independently of the specific input data.
