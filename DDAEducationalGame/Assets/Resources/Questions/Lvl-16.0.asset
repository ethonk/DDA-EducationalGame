  question: Which of the following is an example of a non-deterministic Turing machine?
  questionImage: {fileID: 0}
  answerA: Deterministic finite automaton
  answerB: Pushdown automaton
  answerC: Nondeterministic Turing machine
  answerExplanation: A nondeterministic Turing machine is a theoretical computational
    model that extends the capabilities of a deterministic Turing machine by allowing
    multiple possible transitions from a given state. This introduces the notion
    of multiple parallel computations.
  answer: 3
