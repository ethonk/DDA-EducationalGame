  question: What is the term for a programming error that causes a program to behave
    unexpectedly or crash?
  questionImage: {fileID: 21300000, guid: 7e38826dcba8589449024ab39159f64b, type: 3}
  answerA: Syntax error
  answerB: Runtime error
  answerC: Logic error
  answerExplanation: A runtime error occurs when a program is running and encounters
    an unexpected condition that leads to abnormal behavior or crash, such as division
    by zero or accessing an invalid memory location. Syntax errors relate to incorrect
    syntax, and logic errors result in flawed program behavior.
