  question: What is the time complexity of the quicksort algorithm in the average
    case?
  questionImage: {fileID: 21300000, guid: 475b286451106fe488987fa1bd872503, type: 3}
  answerA: O(n)
  answerB: O(n^2)
  answerC: O(n log n)
  answerExplanation: Quicksort has an average time complexity of O(n log n), which
    means its performance grows proportionally to the input size multiplied by the
    logarithm of the input size. This makes quicksort an efficient sorting algorithm
    for large data sets on average.
